# AI-Driven Sustainable Agriculture System

## 🌱 Introduction
Agriculture is essential for human survival, but traditional farming practices often lead to environmental challenges like soil degradation, excessive fertilizer use, and water wastage. By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data-driven technologies, this project aims to promote sustainable farming practices while improving productivity.

---

## 🚜 Challenge Overview
The project involves developing a **multi-agent AI system** that connects key stakeholders in agriculture—farmers, weather stations, and agricultural experts. The goal is to optimize farming practices, reduce environmental impact, minimize water usage, and promote long-term sustainability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Reduce carbon footprint and mitigate soil erosion.
- Provide sustainable fertilizer recommendations.
- Assist farmers with smart, data-driven decisions.
- Enable collaboration among AI agents for optimal farming outcomes.

---

## 🤝 Stakeholders and Agents

### 1. **Farmer Advisor Agent**
   - Analyzes crop, land, and financial inputs from farmers.
   - Suggests crop rotations and sustainable farming practices.

### 2. **Market Researcher Agent**
   - Evaluates regional demand, crop pricing trends, and market fluctuations.
   - Recommends high-demand and profitable crops.

### 3. **Weather Monitoring Agent**
   - Integrates real-time weather data.
   - Advises on the best planting/harvesting windows.

### 4. **Smart Fertilizer Advisor Agent** *(Newly Proposed)*
   - Uses environmental and historical data to recommend optimal fertilizer type and quantity.
   - Minimizes overuse and reduces runoff pollution.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system architecture involves multiple agents working collaboratively:
1. **Farmer Input** → Farmer Advisor Agent
2. **Weather API** → Weather Monitoring Agent
3. **Market Data** → Market Researcher Agent
4. All data is processed by a **Central Decision Engine**, which outputs recommendations to a **Mobile Application**.
5. Long-term data is stored in an **SQLite Database**.
